This theme is meant to be a less blurry and sharper alternitive to the popular [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) that I used to use.

		Here's a boring technical explanation on why these icons are not blurry.
	</summary>
	The file icons in vscode are `16px`. In other themes the icons are `24px` which means they get scaled down to `16px` by vscode and are made blurry as a result. These icons are designed at `16px` which mean no scaling is done by vscode and the icons remain sharp.

There are many themes to match themes such as Solarized, Gruvbox and Monokai. Each theme also has a "folderless" variant if you prefer the arrows in the default vscode theme.

These are the icons that have been made so far:
